## Hi there 👋

🌿 About Me

Hello, and welcome. My name is Ever Jackson, and my life has been shaped by two powerful callings: my early Christian foundation and my present witchcraft practice. Both have taught me that service, courage, and care for community are sacred responsibilities.

✝️ My Mission in Life: Christian Roots

My journey began in the 1980s as a Missionette at Sunnyslope Christian Center, where I learned discipline, leadership, and devotion. Later, I attended Calvary Christian School, which deepened my commitment to faith, integrity, and living a life of service. Those years instilled in me the belief that true spiritual practice is not only about prayer or ritual, but also about helping others, standing for justice, and offering compassion without hesitation.

🔮 My Witchcraft Practice

Today, my path has grown into earth-centered witchcraft, where I carry forward the same mission of service in a new way. I am a Third-Degree Witch, fully initiated and recognized within my tradition, dedicated to teaching, leading, and upholding the responsibilities of advanced practice.

I am also working to establish myself as the first recognized witch in San Benito County, California, offering:

Community rituals that honor nature and ancestry

Educational workshops for those seeking knowledge of spiritual practice

Spiritual guidance and support rooted in inclusivity, consent, and respect


My witchcraft practice is not a rejection of my Christian past — it is a continuation of my lifelong calling to uplift, protect, and serve. Where my Christian foundation gave me faith and structure, my witchcraft practice gives me connection to earth, spirit, and community.

🌟 Core Values

Service — Devotion to uplifting others

Integrity — Walking with honesty and accountability

Inclusivity — Respecting all spiritual paths and people

Stewardship — Caring for the land, ancestors, and future generations


✨ My Ongoing Mission

Whether through church pews or sacred circles, I have always been called to serve. My vision is to weave together these experiences into a path that brings recognition, respect, and community strength here in San Benito County and beyond.

Would you like me to also design a short, polished 2–3 sentence bio (highlighting you as a Third-Degree Witch and your Christian roots) so you can use it on social media profiles, business cards, or for formal recognition requests?

Would you like me to write this up as a polished “About Me” page for your website (so you can copy/paste directly), or would you prefer a formal mission statement (short, legal-sounding) that you could also use in recognition requests with the county/state?
